	* NEW: add the funciton that when the program begin, it will automatical
	ly run the self_checking. The content includes database and profile.
	add the function that the program can sync with the remote NTP server. 

2015-11-1 Linghao <1196422862@qq.com>
	* NEW: add the function that the program can detect the network problem
	and run the reconnect program. The main way is to use SNDTIMEO and RCV
	TIMEO arguments.
	Now, the program can run for a long time even if there happen some
	problem. 

2015-10-29 Linghao <1196422862@qq.com>
	* DEBUG: in client_pipe.c, when update the database, the funciton may do
	an error exit. By testing, the main reason is that multiprocess cannot
	write the database at the same time. The temporary solution is to detect
	the SQLITE_BUSY and do the operation again. 

2015-10-26 Linghao <1196422862@qq.com>
	* NEWS: add the scaning function. It is used to scan the PLC IP and port
	when PLC IP is not known, and keep it in the profile device.config. Then
	to get the PLC configuration information. 


2015-10-22 Linghao <1196428262@qq.com>
	* NEWS: add the debugging function, use the macro-DEBUG to deal with the
	error and debug ok.


2015-10-10 Linghao <1196422862@qq.com>
	* data_deal.c&client_pipe.c: change shared memory's initial setting, 
	solve the problem that data cannot transmit by shared memory
	* client_pipe.c: 
		1 when recving real-time command, add the function to use
		condition variable to unblock the sending process.
		2 when recving real-time profile, solve the problem transmitted data
		whose size is bigger then 1k cannot be received perfectly 
	* NEWS: normal data/real-time data/changing rate command are O.K.


2015-10-09 Linghao <1196422862@qq.com>
	* DEBUG: when inserting blob data into sqlite3, the function
	sqlite3_prepare_v2() is needed. But when insert blob and other type data
	at the same time, sqlite3_exec() and sqlite3_prepare_v2() are needed
	together, which remains a problem.
	* NEWS: the normal data transmission has completed after debugging with
	the server.


2015-10-07 Linghao <1196422862@qq.com>
	* NEWS: provide a new version(comtest_pipe.c&client_pipe.c) to 
	instead of the origin version,which use named pipe to transmit real-time	data.
	* comtest_pipe.c&client_pipe.c: when recving a real_time command, open
	the pipe to transmit and after that, close the pipe.
	* DEBUG: the real-time function has been running properly
	* problem: there exist some problems in plc_simulate.c, which runs
	unstedily


2015-10-06 Linghao <1196422862@qq.com>
	* NEWS: create real_time.xml to record the real-time data of  facility
	* plc_simulate.c: add the simulating data using function sin() instead 
	of random data
	* comtest.c: 
		1 add a new structure to store the real_time data; 
	    2 add the function to read the real-time data from real_time.xml; 
		3 add the function to draw real-time data from raw data by using the
		new structure
	* client.c: add a new process when the device is logining in the remote
	center to tell the center about the plc data location and get the
	real-time data, whose form is xml


2015-09-27 Linghao <1196422862@qq.com>
	* rmfsystem.h: change struct msg_local shm_local 
	msg_remote msg_remote shm_remote and add length field
	* client.c comtest.c data_deal.c: according the changes in rmfsystem.h,
	adjust the program
	* NEWS: the debaugging task has basically completed
	* problem: there is divergence in real_time module 
	and difficulties in the plc simulation program



2015-09-24 Linghao <1196422862@qq.com>
	* NEWS:add ChangeLog & read_file.h & change_profile.h
	* client.c: 
		use addoraltconfig() to replace change_config() and
		change_file()
	* comtest.c:
		1: add the function that this program can communicate with 
		plc_simulate() by TCP and UDP
		2: add read_plcfile() to read the device.config
